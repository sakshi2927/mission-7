## AI Prompts Used During Development

This file documents the basic prompts I used with an AI assistant while building the **Registration Wizard** project.  
The goal was to get light guidance and clarification, not full solutions or copy-paste code.

## Notes

- The AI was used as a learning assistant, not to generate the full project.
- All core logic, component structure, and styling decisions were implemented by me.
- This project was built to practice React state management, controlled components, and form validation.
